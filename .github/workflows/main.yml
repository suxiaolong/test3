  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch

  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel

    # The type of runner that the job will run on

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [10.x]

    steps: # 步骤
      - name: Checkout # 步骤1
        uses: actions/checkout@v1 # 使用的动作。格式：userName/repoName。作用：检出仓库，获取源码。 官方actions库：https://github.com/actions
      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }} # 步骤2
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1 # 作用：安装nodejs
        with:
